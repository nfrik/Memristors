# Memristors

This is an implementation of Strukov's TiO2 memristor.
The goal is to understand if we can simulate neural networks made of memristors.
In particular I seek for answers to the following questions: what network architectures are useful, what is the minimal complexity of network node, what kind signals should we use etc.

Backlog:
0. Write good circuit generator
1. Integration of equation of the state of memristors instead of approximation
2. Add more models
3. Speed improvement and bugs elimination
4. Add GUI to control simulation
5.
