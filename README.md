# Memristors

Memristors

This legacy repo contains a basic implementation of Strukov's TiO2 memristor model.
This was an attempt to answer the following questions: what network architectures are useful for computation with non volatile memristors, what is the minimal complexity of network architecture, what type of signals we should use, etc.

Backlog:
0. Write a good circuit generator
1. Integration of equation of the state of memristors instead of an approximation
2. Add more models
3. Speed improvement and bugs elimination
4. Add GUI to control simulation
5.
